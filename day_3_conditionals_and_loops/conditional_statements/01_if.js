// If Statements check for a Boolean value, if something is true it is known as a truthy statement
// Truthy - if condition is or can be converted to true
// Falsy - if condition is or can be converted to true
// Some falsy expressions are: null, NaN(not a number), 0, an empty string (""), and undefined

// If a condition is true, then JS will execute(perform) the code in the block
// Checks for a singular condition, either true outcome or false outcome

// Declare a variable 
let ifOpen = true;

// The condition to check is held in ( )
if (isOpen === true) {
    // The code to perform if the condition is met is held in { }
    console.log('The door is open.')
};

// If statement checks if the value in the parenthesis is true
if (isOpen) {
    console.log('The door is unlocked and open.')
};

//Can test false values
let isOpen = false;

if (isOpen === false) {
    console.log('The door is shut.')
};
